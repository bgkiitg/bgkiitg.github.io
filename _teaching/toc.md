## Functions, Relations, and Partial Orders
- **Functions**: Mapping between sets, types (injective, surjective, bijective).
- **Relations**: Definitions, properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive), equivalence relations.
- **Partial Orders**: Posets, Hasse diagrams, lattices.

## Recurrences, Summations, Generating Functions, and Asymptotics
- **Recurrences**: Techniques for solving recurrence relations (substitution, recurrence trees, master theorem).
- **Summations**: Evaluating and simplifying series.
- **Generating Functions**: Formal power series as tools for solving combinatorial problems.
- **Asymptotics**: Big-O, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega notations; analyzing growth rates.

## Graphs: Basic Concepts
- **Graph Terminology**: Vertices, edges, paths, cycles.
- **Types of Graphs**: Directed, undirected, weighted, bipartite, planar graphs.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), MST (Kruskal, Prim).

## Elementary Logic and Proof Techniques
- **Propositional Logic**: Syntax, semantics, truth tables, logical equivalence.
- **Predicate Logic**: Quantifiers, predicates, interpretations.
- **Proof Techniques**: Direct proof, proof by contradiction, induction.

## Formal Languages and Automata
### Alphabets, Languages, and Grammars
- **Alphabet**: A finite set of symbols.
- **Language**: A set of strings over an alphabet.
- **Grammar**: Rules for generating strings in a language (Chomsky normal form, production rules).

### Finite Automata and Regular Languages
- **Finite Automata**: Deterministic (DFA) and Non-deterministic (NFA).
- **Regular Expressions**: Notation for defining regular languages.
- **Regular Languages**: Closure properties, pumping lemma.

### Context-Free Languages and Pushdown Automata
- **Context-Free Grammars**: Production rules with a single non-terminal on the left-hand side.
- **Pushdown Automata**: Automata with a stack for memory.
- **Properties**: Pumping lemma for context-free languages.

### Turing Machines and Recursively Enumerable Languages
- **Turing Machines**: Formal definition, configurations, halting problem.
- **Recursively Enumerable Languages**: Languages accepted by Turing machines.
- **Decidability**: Problems solvable by algorithms.

### Chomsky Hierarchy
- **Hierarchy Levels**:
  1. Type 3: Regular languages (Finite automata).
  2. Type 2: Context-free languages (Pushdown automata).
  3. Type 1: Context-sensitive languages.
  4. Type 0: Recursively enumerable languages (Turing machines).
