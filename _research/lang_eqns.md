I investigated  the decision problem associated with conjugacy equation. This is in general an undeciable problem. We obtained some partial results under certain restrictions on the form of $$X$$ and $$Y$$. The results are summarized in my PhD Thesis.

Here is  a short description of the problems addressed.

Let $$A$$ and $$B$$  be a set of strings over some alphabet. By $$AB$$ we denote the set of all possible strings obtainable by concatenating $$a \in A$$ with a $$b \in B$$. We look at the following algorithmic question. 

**Input** Two sets of strings $$X,Y$$.

**Output** YES if there exists set $$Z$$ such that $$XZ= ZY$$ . NO otherwise.


The equation $$XZ=ZY$$ is called the conjugacy equation. This probelm, in general, is undecidable.
 We look at the cases when  $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are small finite sets and found some characterizations.
