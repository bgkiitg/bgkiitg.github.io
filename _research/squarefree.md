A mapping from $$\mathbb{Z}^2$$ to a finite alphabet is called a two dimensional word. If the word corresponding to every discrete line of is repetition free, then we call a repetition free word. We show that it is impossible to construct a two dimensional repetition free word using eight letters. This improves a thirty year old bound given by Carpi.
