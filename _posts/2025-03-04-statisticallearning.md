 What really is a learning problem from a statistical point of view?


<br>
Consider the function $$f(x)= x+ 2x^3$$. The python code  given below samples this function
10000 times from the range $$[-2,2]$$. The sampled value at $$x$$ is not exactly $$f(x)$$ but has a "noise" which is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance 1.
{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return x + 2 * (x ** 3)

# Generate 10000 x values in the range [-2, 2]
x_values = np.random.uniform(-2, 2, 10000)
y_values = f(x_values) + np.random.normal(0, 1, 10000)

# Plot the points
plt.scatter(x_values, y_values, alpha=0.5, s=5, label="Noisy Data")
plt.xlabel("x values")
plt.ylabel("y values")
plt.title("Scatter Plot of Sampled Points")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Print the first 10 points as a sample
for i in range(10):
    print(f"Point on the curve: (x={x_values[i]:.4f}, y={y_values[i]:.4f})")

The scatter plot of the data generated by this program is shown below.

The statistical learning problem is :

Given just this scatter plot(data) , can you guess what the underlying function was?

**Theorem** 
**Proof**

$$X_{n+1} = \Delta_n S_n + (1+r)(X_n- \Delta_n S_n)$$

One can show that this wealth process is also a martingale under risk neutral measure.
