 What really is a learning problem from a statistical point of view?


<br>
Consider the function $$f(x)= x+ 2x^3$$. The python code  given below samples this function
10000 times from the range $$[-2,2]$$. The sampled value at $$x$$ is not exactly $$f(x)$$ but has a "noise" which is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance 1.
{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return x + 2 * (x ** 3)

# Generate 10000 x values in the range [-2, 2]
x_values = np.random.uniform(-2, 2, 10000)
y_values = f(x_values) + np.random.normal(0, 1, 10000)

# Plot the points
plt.scatter(x_values, y_values, alpha=0.5, s=5, label="Noisy Data")
plt.xlabel("x values")
plt.ylabel("y values")
plt.title("Scatter Plot of Sampled Points")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Print the first 10 points as a sample
for i in range(10):
    print(f"Point on the curve: (x={x_values[i]:.4f}, y={y_values[i]:.4f})")

The scatter plot of the data generated by this program is shown below.

The statistical learning problem is :

Given just this scatter plot(data) , can you guess what the underlying function was?

With this data, can you deduce that the  $$f(x)= x+ 2x^3$$.  How much data do you need to make  this inference? If another person generated data using the same program, does her data also, when analysed give us the conclusion that the underlying function was  $$f(x)= x+ 2x^3$$?


In many real life situations, we just have the data. We do not know that the data was generated by a python code or some deterministic process plus some randomness. We abstract all these uncertainities to randomness and hope to recover the "true" function $$f$$ from the data.
